## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packages}
if(!require(pacman))install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load('dplyr', 'tidyr', 'gapminder',
               'ggplot2',  'ggalt',
               'forcats', 'R.utils', 'png', 
               'grid', 'ggpubr', 'scales',
               'bbplot')

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r read file, echo=FALSE}
file = "https://datahub.io/machine-learning/diabetes/r/diabetes.csv"
diabetesData <- read.csv(file)

# Replaces 0s in all columns with NAs except for preg and class.
diabetesData$plas[diabetesData$plas == 0] <- NA
diabetesData$pres[diabetesData$pres == 0] <- NA
diabetesData$skin[diabetesData$skin == 0] <- NA
diabetesData$insu[diabetesData$insu == 0] <- NA
diabetesData$mass[diabetesData$mass == 0] <- NA
diabetesData$pedi[diabetesData$pedi == 0] <- NA

# Drops rows with NAs in all columns except for preg and class.
diabetesData <- na.omit(diabetesData)

# Renames columns for easier readability
diabetesData <- data.frame(Pregnancies=diabetesData$preg, GlucoseLevel=diabetesData$plas, BloodPressure=diabetesData$pres, SkinThickness=diabetesData$skin, Insulin=diabetesData$insu, BMI=diabetesData$mass, DiabetesPedigreeFunction=diabetesData$pedi, Age=diabetesData$age, Outcome=diabetesData$class)

head(diabetesData)
```

## Frequency of Diabetes Between Age and Number of Pregnancies

Plot 1 measures the frequency of diabetes in women of Pima indigenous heritage living near Phoenix, Arizona as they age. Older women are more likely to be tested positive for diabetes than younger women.

```{r age diabetic plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=Outcome, y=Age)) + geom_point(position="Jitter", width=0.25, alpha=0.5) + labs(y="Age", x="Diabetes Status", title="Frequency of Diabetes in Women", subtitle="Of Pima indigenous heritage near Phoenix, AZ") + theme(legend.position = "top", legend.justification = "left") + bbc_style() + theme(axis.title = element_text())
```
## Frequency of Diabetes Between Age and Number of Pregnancies

Plot 2 measures the frequency of diabetes in women of Pima indigenous heritage living near Phoenix, Arizona as they age or have more children. The older the woman, the more likely she gets diabetes. Women who had more children are more likely to be tested positive for diabetes. Women who had about 5 or more children tend to have a higher percentage of positive diabetes diagnosis.

```{r age pregnancies, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=Pregnancies, y=Age, color=Outcome)) + geom_point(position="Jitter", width=0.25, alpha=0.5) + labs(y="Age", x="Number of Pregnancies", title="Frequency of Diabetes in Women", subtitle="Of Pima indigenous heritage near Phoenix, AZ") + theme(legend.position = "top", legend.justification = "left") + bbc_style() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) + scale_colour_manual(values = c("#2D9900", "red"))
```

## Frequency of Diabetes Between Age and Blood Pressure Level

Plot 3 measures the frequency of diabetes between age and blood pressure. In general, those who are older and have higher blood pressure tend to be tested for diabetes.

```{r age blood pressure plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=BloodPressure, y=Age, color=Outcome)) + geom_point(position="Jitter", width=0.25, alpha=0.5) + labs(y="Age", x="Blood Pressure Level", title="Frequency of Diabetes in Women", subtitle="Of Pima indigenous heritage near Phoenix, AZ") + theme(legend.position = "top", legend.justification = "left") + bbc_style() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) + scale_colour_manual(values = c("#2D9900", "red"))
```
## Frequency of Diabetes Between BMI and Blood Glucose Level

Plot 4 measures the frequency of diabetes between insulin level and BMI. In general, women with higher blood glucose level and higher BMI are at risk of diabetes.

```{r hbA1c glucose levels plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=GlucoseLevel, y=BMI, color=Outcome)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) + geom_jitter(alpha=0.5) + labs(y="BMI", x="Blood Glucose Level", title="Frequency of Diabetes in Women", subtitle="Of Pima indigenous heritage near Phoenix, AZ") + theme(legend.position = "top", legend.justification = "left") + bbc_style() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) + scale_colour_manual(values = c("#2D9900", "red"))
```
## Frequency of Diabetes Between Insulin Level and Blood Glucose Level

Plot 5 measures the frequency of diabetes between insulin level and glucose level. In general, people wit higher glucose level and lower insulin level are at risk of diabetes.

```{r insulin glucose levels plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=Insulin, y=GlucoseLevel, color=Outcome)) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) + geom_jitter(alpha=0.5) + bbc_style() + theme(axis.title = element_text()) + scale_colour_manual(values = c("#2D9900", "red"))
```

## Frequency of Diabetes Between hbA1c Level and Blood Glucose Level

Plot 3 measures the frequency of diabetes between hbA1c level and blood glucose level. Lighter colors represent higher levels of HbA1c and vice versa. In general, people who have diabetes have higher blood glucose and HbA1c levels.

```{r apriori, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(3)
appearance = list(default = "lhs", rhs = ("Outcome=tested_positive"))
parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8)

library(arules)
library(arulesViz)

# Converts data frame to transactions.
trans <- as(diabetesData, "transactions")

#Uses apriori() function on diabetic people.
rules <- apriori(trans, parameter = parameter, appearance = appearance)

# Views rules.
inspect(rules)
```
Uses arulesViz to visualize the results.

```{r}
# BEGIN SOLUTION
library(arulesViz)

plot(rules, main = "Diabetes")
"
[The x axis represents the support while the y axis represents the confidence or lift. Support indicates how frequently a set of items appear in the data. It is the number of transactions that contains this set. Confidence or lift indicates how often the support rule is true. Lift is a measure of association using both support and confidence. The lift value of an association rule includes the list of rules whose confidence is above the threshold.]
"
# END SOLUTION
```
Sorts the list of previously created rules and uses lift > 2.8 to find the best rules.
```{r}
# BEGIN SOLUTION
# Sort the list of previously created rules.
sortedRules <- sort(rules)

# Uses lift > 0.99 to find the best rules.
subrules <- subset(sortedRules, lift>2.9)
plot(subrules)
```
