## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packages}
if(!require(pacman))install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load('dplyr', 'tidyr', 'gapminder',
               'ggplot2',  'ggalt',
               'forcats', 'R.utils', 'png', 
               'grid', 'ggpubr', 'scales',
               'bbplot')

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r read file, echo=FALSE}
file = "data\\diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv"
diabetesData <- read.csv(file)
head(diabetesData)
```

## Frequency of Diabetes Between Genders and Age

Plot 1 measures the frequency of diabetes between men, women, and other as they age. The older the person, the more likely they get diabetes. Men are slightly more likely to have diabetes at a younger age than women.

```{r age gender plot, echo=FALSE}
# Changes binary numbers in diabetes column to Yes and No.
diabetesData <- diabetesData %>% mutate(diabetes = ifelse(diabetes == 0, "No", "Yes"))
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=gender, y=age, color=(diabetes))) + geom_point(position="Jitter", width=0.25, alpha=0.5)
```
