## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packages}
if(!require(pacman))install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load('dplyr', 'tidyr', 'gapminder',
               'ggplot2',  'ggalt',
               'forcats', 'R.utils', 'png', 
               'grid', 'ggpubr', 'scales',
               'bbplot')

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r read file, echo=FALSE}
file = "data\\diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv"
diabetesData <- read.csv(file)

# Changes binary numbers in diabetes column to Yes and No.
diabetesData <- diabetesData %>% mutate(diabetes = ifelse(diabetes == 0, "No", "Yes"))

# Changes binary numbers in hypertension column to Yes and No.
diabetesData <- diabetesData %>% mutate(hypertension = ifelse(hypertension == 0, "No", "Yes"))

# Changes binary numbers in heart_disease column to Yes and No.
diabetesData <- diabetesData %>% mutate(heart_disease = ifelse(heart_disease == 0, "No", "Yes"))

head(diabetesData)
```

## Frequency of Diabetes Between Genders and Age

Plot 1 measures the frequency of diabetes between men, women, and other as they age. The older the person, the more likely they get diabetes. Men are slightly more likely to have diabetes at a younger age than women.

```{r age gender plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=gender, y=age, color=(diabetes))) + geom_point(position="Jitter", width=0.25, alpha=0.5)
```
## Frequency of Diabetes Between Age and Smoking History

Plot 2 measures the frequency of diabetes between age and heart disease. The older the person, the more likely they get diabetes. Smokers and those with any smoking history tend to have a higher chance of getting heart disease than non-smokers.

```{r age smoking plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=diabetes, y=age, color=(heart_disease))) + geom_point(position="Jitter", width=0.25, alpha=0.5)
```

## Frequency of Diabetes Between hbA1c Level and Blood Glucose Level

Plot 3 measures the frequency of diabetes between hbA1c level and blood glucose level. Lighter colors represent higher levels of HbA1c and vice versa. In general, people who have diabetes have higher blood glucose and HbA1c levels.

```{r hbA1c glucose levels plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(diabetesData, aes(x=diabetes, y=blood_glucose_level, color=(HbA1c_level))) + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape=NA) + geom_jitter(alpha=0.5)
```
